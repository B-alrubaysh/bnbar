### ðŸ§ª testing.mdc

#### Goal:
Ensure all major flows (upload, process, download) work reliably with different image formats, sizes, and failure scenarios.

---

#### Manual Testing Checklist
- âœ… Upload `.jpeg`, `.png` images under 5MB
- âœ… Try oversized images (>5MB) and expect proper rejection
- âœ… Drag-and-drop interaction works on mobile and desktop
- âœ… Test preview and download buttons on all major browsers
- âœ… Retry flow: after failure, retrying works correctly

---

#### Automated Tests (if applicable)
- âœ… Mock upload -> process -> return flow via Playwright or Cypress
- âœ… Ensure blob response can be downloaded by the user
- âœ… Confirm frontend rejects unsupported file formats
- âœ… Clear all temp data after each test (no memory/file leaks)

---

#### Edge Case Testing
- Corrupt image file
- Drag/drop multiple files
- Mobile camera capture image test
- Rapid multiple uploads (rate-limit stress)

---

#### Rule Summary
âœ… Enforced:
- Upload â†’ Process â†’ Download is consistently working
- Error messages are clear
- No leftover temp files, cache, or blob leaks

ðŸš« Avoid:
- Relying only on unit tests â€” user flow > function calls
