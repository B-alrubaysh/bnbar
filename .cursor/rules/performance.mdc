Cursor Rules Tech Stack4o

You said:
hi' i'm building a website that is only remove the image's background, and i will be building it with cursor so before i start i want to let u now that it has to be extremely fast and almost free to build,
so what i want u to do is build cursor rules and use this repo to know more about cursor rules best practices:
https://github.com/PatrickJS/awesome-cursorrules

also list me the suggest tech stacks and name your list of rules.

Great! Here's a plan tailored for your background remover website built with Cursor, focusing on speed, minimal cost, and best practices from the awesome-cursorrules repo.

âœ… Suggested Tech Stack (Fast + Cheap)
Layer	Tech Recommendation
Frontend	Next.js with Tailwind CSS
Image Upload	react-dropzone or uploadthing (supports low-latency file uploads)
Background Removal	remove.bg API (free tier) OR open-source like U^2-Net deployed on Replicate
Backend	Serverless Functions (Vercel/Netlify or Supabase Edge Functions)
Hosting	Vercel (free tier is fast and solid for image tools)
Auth (if needed)	Clerk (great free tier), or Supabase Auth
Database (optional)	Supabase (Postgres) or skip it for a static tool
File Storage	Supabase Storage, or store temporarily in memory if not saving images
ðŸ§  Cursor Rule Files to Include
Hereâ€™s a naming convention for your Cursor rules, inspired by the repo you shared:

Filename	Purpose
project-structure.mdc	Directory structure, where frontend, API, assets go
performance.mdc	Rules on fast-loading UI, image compression, serverless cold start tips
backend.mdc	How to structure/remove.bg or U^2-Net API integration
ui-ux.mdc	Design consistency, dropzone behavior, UI responsiveness
auth.mdc (optional)	Rules if you decide to add user login
storage.mdc (optional)	How/where to store uploaded & processed images
security.mdc	Prevent abuse, throttle API usage, file size limits
testing.mdc	Basic tests for upload/response cycles, file type handling
deployment.mdc	Where and how to deploy with settings for best cold-start performance
cost-optimization.mdc	Use free-tier resources, caching rules, limits on usage
ðŸ“¦ Next Steps
Would you like me to go ahead and start drafting these rule files, beginning with project-structure.mdc and performance.mdc?

Also let me know:

Are you using remove.bg or planning on deploying your own model (like U^2-Net)?

Will you store processed images or just show + allow download?

Do you need any login/authentication or will it be anonymous usage?

Once I know that, Iâ€™ll tailor the rules even more precisely for your setup.

You said:
for tech stack:
- use  U^2-Net for bg removal
- for backend use vercel and supabase
- no need for auth
- no need for database "client side"
- also no need

for rules:
- remove cost optimisation mdc
- and remove any rule that is related to any removed part of the tech stack such as auth

start
ChatGPT said:
The first two rule files are now ready:

project-structure.mdc â€“ Clean architecture using Next.js + Vercel Serverless + Replicate.

performance.mdc â€“ Fast load, compressed images, edge functions, and low-latency rules.

Next up: Iâ€™ll proceed to draft these rule files:

backend.mdc

ui-ux.mdc

security.mdc

testing.mdc

deployment.mdc

Let me know if you'd like to prioritize any of them first or add/remove anything else before I continue.

continue, do them all at once don;t stop

### âš¡ performance.mdc

#### Goal:
Ensure lightning-fast performance across the entire background remover app using best-in-class practices for image apps with serverless architecture.

---

#### Client-Side Performance Rules
- âœ… Use `<Image />` from Next.js with `priority` prop for above-the-fold assets.
- âœ… Defer all non-critical JS (e.g., download buttons, animations).
- âœ… Use Tailwind CSS with PurgeCSS enabled to reduce CSS payload.
- âœ… Compress all static assets.
- âœ… Lazy-load result previews.
- âœ… Use `<Suspense />` + dynamic import for any large component (if needed).

---

#### Serverless Performance Rules
- âœ… Limit all uploads to max 5MB. Reject larger ones early.
- âœ… Use Edge Functions when low latency is critical (e.g., processing trigger).
- âœ… Avoid cold starts by pinging the API periodically via Vercel cron job.
- âœ… Use stream/buffer piping instead of temporary storage.

---

#### U^2-Net API Performance
- âœ… Self-host U^2-Net model on [Replicate](https://replicate.com/) or similar.
- âœ… Ensure model returns only processed data (no logs, no extra payload).
- âœ… Accept only `image/png`, `image/jpeg` for fastest processing.

---

#### Tooling for Speed
- âœ… Use Vercel Analytics to monitor Core Web Vitals.
- âœ… Setup Lighthouse CI for regular checks.
- âœ… Use Brotli + Gzip compression via Vercel headers.

---

#### Rule Summary
âœ… Enforced:
- Lazy-loading & async import
- Streamed processing
- Low image size enforcement
- Minimal external JS
- Model hosted on optimized infra

ðŸš« Avoid:
- Storing intermediate files
- Overusing client-side libraries
- Cold-start sensitive APIs
