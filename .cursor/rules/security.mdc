### ðŸ”’ security.mdc

#### Goal:
Protect the service from abuse, ensure safe file handling, and prevent API misuse while staying serverless and stateless.

---

#### Upload Security
- âœ… Allow only `image/jpeg` and `image/png`
- âœ… Enforce file size limit (max 5MB)
- âœ… Use file signature (magic bytes) checks, not just extensions
- âœ… Reject files with suspicious mime types or unknown headers

---

#### Rate Limiting
- âœ… Middleware IP-based limiter (e.g., 10 req/min/IP)
- âœ… Respond with `429 Too Many Requests` on abuse

---

#### API Safety
- âœ… Timeout API calls to U^2-Net after 20 seconds max
- âœ… Sanitize all forwarded data
- âœ… Donâ€™t expose your Replicate API key in frontend
- âœ… Use `.env.local` for secrets

---

#### UI Protection
- âœ… Escape all dynamic content rendered from response metadata (if shown)
- âœ… Prevent drag-drop override of entire page with `e.preventDefault()`

---

#### Rule Summary
âœ… Enforced:
- File validation (type, size, signature)
- IP rate-limiting
- API key protection
- Short timeouts for inference calls

ðŸš« Avoid:
- Blind trust in file headers
- Leaving keys in client-side JS
- Over-processing giant images
